    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      The Long Island iced tea is the liquor-cabinet equivalent of what the kids
      once called a "suicide soda" (a big ol' splash of every drink from the
      soda fountain into one enormous ice-filled cup). On the face of it, the
      Long Island Iced tea doesn't seem tenable: Vodka, rum, gin, tequila,
      triple sec — all mingling in the same cocktail glass, tempered only by a
      dash of sweet and sour mix and a splash of cola. Sounds like trouble. And
      obviously it can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it's undisputable, this cocktail proves itself an unlikely success,
      and a prime example of when the whole is greater than the sum of its
      parts. Tossing all of these strong spirits together somehow softens the
      edges off of each individual spirit. It's a marvel of science, frankly.
      Somehow this cocktail, seemingly of odds and ends from the liquor cabinet,
      manages the impossible: it actually tastes good. Very good. So be careful
      out there, folks.
